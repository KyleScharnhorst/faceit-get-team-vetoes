Must set an environment variable for your faceit api key, like: `export #FACEIT_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"`

if calling from a script, could be something like: `. ./set_env_vars.sh`

or clobber the line of code getting environment variable and just replace it with a raw string. I'm deving over here and don't want to push my API key to github so I'm doing an environment variable.
